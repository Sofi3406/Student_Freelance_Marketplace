📘 Project Proposal – Student Freelance Marketplace
1. Project Title
Student Freelance Marketplace: A Platform for Student Talent and Opportunities
________________________________________
2. Problem Statement
Many students have valuable skills in programming, design, tutoring, content writing, and other fields. However, they often lack a platform to showcase these skills and connect with potential clients. On the other hand, individuals and small businesses face difficulty finding affordable and motivated talent.
Existing freelance platforms (like Fiverr or Upwork) are not tailored to students, often requiring high competition, professional portfolios, and global exposure that may overwhelm beginners.
Therefore, there is a need for a dedicated marketplace that connects students with clients, enabling them to earn income, gain real-world experience, and build their professional portfolio.
